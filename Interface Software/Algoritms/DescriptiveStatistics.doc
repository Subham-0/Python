                        Deseriptive Staties
There are divided into 3 parts.
1 - Majors of central tendency
2 - Majors of Variations
3 - Majors of Shape
Major of Central tendency
‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾
        Common majors of central tendency are Mean,Meadian,Mode,Percential,Quartile

Mean : It is the average for the group of number which may be order or unorder
 1  2  2
 m = 6/3 = 2
Mode : The elements which occurs frequently in dataset
        Make the elements in order format
        [1,3,4,5,1] = 1
        Make the elements in ordered format to find the heighest occurance.
Midian :It is the middle value of the order dataset
        [1,2,3,4,5] = 3      
Population Mean : It is the same as the that of Mean 
                ΣX
        μ = —————————————
                N
        x = 1 2 3 4 5
Quartile : It is a component of majors of central tendency that divides the group of elements into 4.
Q1 = 0 to 25
Q2 = 25 to 50
Q3 = 50 to 75

Example : 106   109     114     116
          121   122     125     129

          Q1 = 25/100*8 = 2
          Q2 = 55/100*8 = 4
          Q3 = 75/100*8 = 6

Majors of Variability

It describes the dispersions of set of datas and it has the following common component.
1- Range 
2- Inter Quatile
3- Main Absolute Deviation
4- Variance
5- Standard Deviation
6- Co-efficient of Variance

⒈Range
‾‾‾‾‾‾‾
It is the difference between maximun value and the minimum value of the dataset.
5
        44
                32
∆ = 44-5 = 39

⒉Inner Quatile Range
‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾
It is difference between Q3 and Q1 
IQR = 123.5-111.5 = 12.0

            PV = ∆² = 130/5 = 26.0
            Population Standard deviation = √PV =  √∆² =  √26.0 = 5.1

            Co-efficient Of Variance - It the ratio between ∆ and μ 

                C.V = ∆/μ = 5.1/13 = 0.393
