            Oracel
We have to open two files 
    1-init.ora
    2-tnsnames.ora
    inside Oracel floder

C:\oraclexe\app\oracle\product\10.2.0\server\config\scripts

PORT = 1521
In oracle wea are having two port number
8080 -browser port
1521 - Database tabel space port


step 1 - python -m pip install cx_Oracle
         if required a build tool then just install https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/
step 2 - C:\Users\HP>lsnrctl status(in command prompt to get status of orcel database)


        (PORT=1521)  👈🏽
      
        Instance "xe", status READY, has 1 handler(s) for this service... 👈🏽

step 3 -  Oracle Instant Client installation in Windows
      Table of Contents

      In this post we will install Oracle Instant Client that enables communication between python scripts and Oracle database.

      Why use Oracle Instant Client

      Without Oracle Instant Client, python scripts cannot communicate with the oracle database.

      When is Instant Client not required
      If you computer that is running the python scripts already has Oracle database installed in it, Instant Client may not be required.

      But there can be cases where the Oracle is 32 bit and python is 64 bit or vice-versa, where Instant Client installation will be necessary even if Oracle Database is installed in the computer.
      Downloading the Instant Client
      Download Oracle Instant Client from https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/instant-client/downloads.html or search for “Oracle Instant Client download” if this link does not work
      Download the relevant zip file by clicking on the link like “Instant Client for Microsoft Windows (x64)”
      Download the basic package zip file
      
      Installing Instant Client in Windows machine
      Download Oracle Instant Client Package - zip file
      Create an installation directory like C:\instantclient
      Copy the zip file to the installation directory and unzip the zip file there.
      Now all the instant client files will be in the folder C:\instantclient
      Include the above folder path C:\instantclient\ in PATH and OCI_LIB64 system environment variables
      If we get an error in python script something like “32 bit instant client not found”, then remove the 64 bit files and folders and install a 32 bit version of Instant Client.
      Interfacing with Oracle database in python scripts

      Along with Oracle Instant client, we also need cx_Oracle python module to interface with Oracle database in python scripts
      To install cx_Oracle python module, run the following command in the python environment
      python -m pip install cx_Oracle
