# a=input()
# b=input()

# it is hard to recognize what is a here so the naming of a varible should be meaningfull and identical

name = input('enter your name')
age = int(input('enter your age'))

# some rule for naming a variable
# A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.
# A variable name cannot start with a number.
# A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
# Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
